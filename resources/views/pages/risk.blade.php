            <p>All investments involve risk. Digital asset markets can be volatile and may experience sharp drawdowns, liquidity crunches, or counter-party failures. Past performance is not indicative of future results.</p>
            <p>Target yields published across Nexo Daily Yield, Weekly Growth, and Managed Portfolios are aspirational. Actual results depend on market conditions, execution quality, and policy changes outside of our control.</p>
            <p>Members should only invest funds they can afford to lock for the recommended term. Diversification, regular monitoring, and adherence to withdrawal windows are essential parts of a disciplined strategy.</p>
